# Notes Manager App

A simple application for managing personal notes using the MERN stack. This app allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) notes with a clean, responsive UI and a robust backend powered by SQLite.

- **CRUD Operations**: 
  - Add new notes with fields:
    - Title (required)
    - Description (required)
    - Category (Work, Personal, Others)
  - Edit or delete existing notes.
- **Search and Filter**:
  - Search notes by title.
  - Filter notes by category.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both mobile and desktop views.

### Backend
- **APIs**:
  - Create a new note.
  - Fetch all notes with optional filters (search by title, filter by category).
  - Update an existing note by ID.
  - Delete a note by ID.
- **Database**:
  - Notes stored in SQLite.
  - Table schema includes fields:
    - `id` (unique identifier)
    - `title` (string)
    - `description` (string)
    - `category` (string, defaults to "Others")
    - `created_at` (timestamp, defaults to current time)
    - `updated_at` (timestamp, updates when modified)
- **Sorting**: Notes sorted by `created_at` in descending order.
